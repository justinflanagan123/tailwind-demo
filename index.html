      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey all, I am a student at
        <a href="https://www.swic.edu/">SWIC</a> and I'm trying to get my
        Associate in Applied Science Graphic Communications. Coding is something
        I fell in love with turing my high school year at
        <a href="https://sites.google.com/columbia4.org/chseagles/home"
          >Columbia</a
        >. After a few coding coding classes i realized that this was something
        I want to pursue as a career. For now I work as a MSA at the Monroe
        County YMCA, which is just a front desk person. I like my job, the
        people are very kind to me and a huge plus is that I get a free
        membership. I hope in the future I can achieve my goal of being a web
        developer.

          Working out is a big thing to me. I started going to the gym around
          2018 to lose weight. While I was working out I got an invitation to go
          powerlifting and really enjoy it. I did two competitions and they
          where a ton of fun, but for now I have taken a break due to back
          issues.
